#Py-Game - Formal Proposition - Eric Stanton

	
##Proposal:
My project is to use the PyGame framework to make a rudimentary 2d game in the python language. Being my first foray into the language i want to properly attempt to show my aptitude to:
- Inter-prate
- Implement
- Iterate
- Initialize

The particular syntax of the code.
 
###Planned (In Progress)
I am attempting to make a game that satisfies the conditions of having:

1. Vivid background elements
2. Proper/playable physics or enemies to overcome
3. Working music system
4. Score iteration or timer.
5. End goal integral to the next condition.
6. A theme consistent through the assets.
