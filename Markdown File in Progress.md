#Py-Game - Formal Proposition - Eric Stanton

	
##Proposal:
My project is to use the PyGame framework to make a rudimentary 2d game in the python language. Being my first foray into the language i want to properly attempt to show my aptitude to:
- Inter-prate
- Implement
- Iterate
- Initialize

The particular syntax of the code.
 
###Planned (In Progress)
I am attempting to make a game that satisfies the conditions of having:

1. Vivid background elements
2. Proper/playable physics or enemies to overcome
3. Working music system
4. Score iteration or timer.
5. End goal integral to the next condition.
6. A theme consistent through the assets.


#Update 11/6/2019:

Workable Game Prototype has been integrated to main Branch. New sprites have been added, and a candy theme has been chosen for the game. 
------------
Physics have been added and with proper platform generation, one issue (platform conjoinment).
------------
Assets Remaining: Music, Background, (Jump, Start, Die) Sound Effects, refinement of game code.
------------
Potential plans: Sideways "dart" enemies with a hit counter, die of certain number counter increments.

Most recent Master Merge - 11/6/2019.
